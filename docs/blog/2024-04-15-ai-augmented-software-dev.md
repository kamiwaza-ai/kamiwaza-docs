The future of software development is AI-augmented, and the benefits are clear. Embrace the power of AI coding assistants and autocoding tools to supercharge your productivity, code quality, learning, and innovation. The future is now.
Here are some key data points on the value and impact of AI coding assistants based on the provided search results:

1. Developers can complete tasks 55% faster using an AI coding assistant, and 75% of developers said they were more productive overall when using one. [1]

2. Using AI-powered coding assistants helps both new and experienced engineers be much more productive. Newer engineers working on basic tasks like creating APIs or integrating data can expect productivity gains of 50% or more. [2]

3. A study found that programmers who used GitHub Copilot completed a sample task in 1.2 hours on average, compared to 2.7 hours on average for those who did not use an AI assistant - a 126% productivity increase. [4]

4. According to a report by GitHub, 88% of developers feel more productive, 96% are faster at completing repetitive tasks, and 74% can focus on more satisfying work when using AI coding assistants. [12]

5. A Stack Overflow survey showed 33% of polled developers see improved productivity as the most valuable benefit of AI-assisted code. [13]

6. 70% of developers using AI coding assistants believe these tools give them an advantage at work, helping improve code quality and speed. [13]

7. In an international study, AI tools helped developers find and fix mistakes faster when translating legacy source code into Python compared to manual translation, even when the AI's suggestions weren't fully correct. [13]

8. Developers reported that GitHub Copilot decreased their estimated task time by 35% on average, though the actual measured productivity gain was 126%. [4]

In summary, studies are consistently finding that AI coding assistants can provide significant productivity boosts to developers, in the range of 35-126% depending on the task and developer experience level. The majority of developers also perceive major productivity and quality benefits from using these AI tools.
