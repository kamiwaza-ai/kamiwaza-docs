# MTS - GenAI Platform Engineer

## Join the AI Revolution from Anywhere | Member of Technical Staff (GenAI Platform Engineer)

We're Kamiwaza ("divine skill" or "godlike technique" - for what we want our customers to experience), and we're building the backbone of the AI revolution. We have a great small team that needs to scale, delighted customers and enthusiastic investors.

## The TL;DR

- üåç Work from wherever you do your best work (we mean it - we're remote-first, with support)
- üöÄ Pre-Series A with strong investor backing and customer traction  
- üí´ Building the platform layer that will power the next decade of AI
- üéØ Sweet spot: You love the intersection of infrastructure, GenAI, and Python

## What's Kamiwaza?

We're creating the connective tissue between AI hardware and applications - think "the platform that lets enterprises use AI without moving their sensitive data around." Our inference mesh and distributed data engine are already helping companies deploy AI across clouds, on-prem, and edge locations. Our platform handles model download, lineage, and deployment; data ingestion, retrieval, and management; and integration authentication and authorization.

With a simple fully-integrated install, we allow our users to immediately search, download, deploy and scale models, ingest data sources into our catalog and pipeline them for transformation or RAG, and optionally intermediate data and model access with our authentication and authorization layer. We provide an awesome development experience, providing consistent REST APIs for everything, a client SDK, and are consistent from our community edition to large-scale enterprise deployments, and across hardware platforms, allowing developers and enterprises to confidently build enterprise GenAI apps that will run anywhere.

Phase 1 is working. Phase 2 and 3 will blow your mind. (Our investors literally cheered during these roadmap presentations.)

## About This Role

As a member of the technical staff (MTS), you'll be architecting and building core platform components that make AI deployment feel like magic to enterprises. Think distributed systems, model management, and data orchestration - but with the twist of making it all work seamlessly with GenAI.

## Your Home Office is Our Office

We're in Colorado, but we want our real HQ to be in your brain. 100% remote, with help.

## You Probably...

- Get genuinely excited about the AI revolution (and want to help shape it)
- Have 5-10+ years building complex software (give or take, we value quick studies)
- Love Python, GenAI, making great dev experiences, and understand the importance of ops
- Read AI papers for fun but feel like you're drinking from a firehose & wouldn't have it any other way

## Tech You'll Touch

- Our core platform (Python, varied hardware, GenAI tooling)
- Things to enable model deployment, data wrangling, seamless scaling, and tight security 
- Data catalogs, embeddings, and retrieval systems
- APIs - designing for developer experience first and more from there
- AI-first tooling (we use AI to build AI tools (to build AI tools))

## The Extra Special Bits

- Equity in a very small, very driven, very well-funded startup with an unbelievably large opportunity
- Competitive salary and comprehensive benefits
- Founders who've had exits but maintain childlike enthusiasm
- Culture: professional team, getting stuff done, high autonomy, flat org, radically transparent
- The chance to change the world - we are bending the adoption curve on the most meaningful technology change since the Internet

## What We Want to Be Like

- Curious, humble, but relentless. The obstacle is the way.
- Fun, kind, exceptional. Side quest: be the best team you'll ever join.
- Driven and accountable; you ship. We have a mission. We are leaving nothing for the swim back.
- Long term thinkers but urgent actors. Action creates clarity.

## Bonus Points If...

- You've contributed to open source, especially in a GenAI-related area
- You've battled with DNS and cloud networking
- You love GenAI but also love physics, math, ML, etc.
- You're already using AI to automate your work

We have more roles to hire for than we have people in the company. But we're going to live the AI first world and we think we curve out on "people" being the limiting factor at least logarithmic to traditional, if not faster. However, this means finding the best people.

P.S. If you use AI to craft your application, we'll know - and we'll delve into it anyhow and love it.
