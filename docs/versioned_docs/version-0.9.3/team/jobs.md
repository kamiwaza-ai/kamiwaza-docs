## Our Co-Founders on What Kamiwaza Is All About

“We’re building the connective tissue between AI hardware and applications — a platform that lets enterprises use AI **without** moving their most sensitive data around. That’s been the dream in the AI space for years: truly distributed, privacy-preserving, scalable AI that’s easier and faster to deploy than anything else out there. We’re all-in on making that happen.”  
— *Luke Norris, CEO & Co-Founder*  

“Kamiwaza is about bringing the best engineering, architecture, and developer experience together, so AI deployment feels like magic. It’s about serious distributed systems, data orchestration, and model management. But it’s also about making sure the experience **just works** — GenAI made accessible through simple installs and consistent APIs.”  
— *Matt Wallace, CTO & Co-Founder*
