### [PICARD: Testing What Models Can Do, Not What They've Seen](/research/papers/picard)

**JV Roig** | July 2025 | Technical Report

A framework for contamination-resistant LLM evaluation through multi-layered randomization. PICARD creates over 10^80 unique test configurations—more than atoms in the observable universe—making memorization impossible while testing real-world agentic tasks like file manipulation, database operations, and multi-step workflows.

**Key Innovation:** Unlike static benchmarks that models can memorize, PICARD generates unique test instances every time while maintaining deterministic scoring and statistical validity. Extends beyond math to complex enterprise scenarios.

### [KAMI v0.1: Enterprise-Relevant Agentic AI Benchmark](/research/papers/kami-v0-1)

**JV Roig** | October 2025 | Technical Report

Lessons from 5.5 billion tokens' worth of agentic AI evaluations showing traditional benchmarks fail to predict real-world performance. Through massive-scale testing of 35 model configurations using the PICARD framework, we demonstrate that models ranking high on traditional benchmarks often fail at practical enterprise tasks.

**Key Finding:** Llama 3.1 70B scored near-bottom on TAU2-Bench but achieved top-tier performance (73.4%) on enterprise tasks. Claude 3.5 Haiku ranked second-worst in AAII but performed near the top on our benchmark.
