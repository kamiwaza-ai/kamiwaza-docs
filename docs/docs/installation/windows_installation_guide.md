# Windows Installation Guide

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 11
- **Memory**: 8GB RAM minimum (16GB+ recommended)
- **GPU**: NVIDIA 50 series and Intel Arc Supported (requires drivers)
- **Storage**: 20GB free disk space
- **Architecture**: x64 (64-bit) processor
- **Administrator Access**: The installer will request permission when needed

### Recommended for Optimal Performance
- **Memory**: 32GB+ RAM for large workloads
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX series or Intel Arc GPU (for hardware acceleration)
- **Storage**: SSD with 50GB+ free space

## Prerequisites Setup

### Step 1: Enable WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

If WSL is not already installed on your system:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
   - Right-click Start button → "Windows PowerShell (Admin)"
2. Install WSL
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
3. Restart your computer when prompted
4. Verify WSL installation
   ```powershell
   wsl --version
   ```

### Step 2: Verify GPU Access (If Applicable)

**Note**: GPU verification will be performed automatically during installation. The installer will detect and configure GPU access for supported hardware.

**Supported GPUs:**
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX series (30, 40 and 50 series)
- Intel Arc GPUs 

**Note**: Kamiwaza currently supports only NVIDIA GPUs and Intel Arc GPUs for hardware acceleration. For Intel Arc GPU setup instructions, please refer to the separate Intel Arc WSL [GPU virtualization documentation](gpu_setup_guide.md#intel-arc-gpu-setup).

### Step 3: Install Windows Terminal (Optional but Recommended)

Download from Microsoft Store or GitHub releases
