# Use Cases

Kamiwaza enables a wide variety of AI applications and workflows. This section provides practical guidance for implementing common use cases, complete with step-by-step instructions, best practices, and example code.

## What You'll Find Here

Each use case guide includes:
- **Overview** - What the use case accomplishes and when to use it
- **Prerequisites** - Required models, services, and setup steps
- **Implementation** - Step-by-step instructions with code examples
- **Best Practices** - Tips for optimization and production deployment
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

## Featured Use Cases

### üìñ [Building a RAG Pipeline](building-a-rag-pipeline.md)
Learn how to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines your documents with large language models to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

**What you'll build:**
- Document ingestion and preprocessing
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Retrieval system for relevant context
- LLM integration for response generation

**Perfect for:** Customer support, internal knowledge bases, document Q&A systems

## Coming Soon

We're working on additional use case guides including:

### ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Systems**
Build sophisticated AI agents that can collaborate to solve complex tasks, with coordination, memory, and tool usage capabilities.

### üéØ **Custom Model Fine-tuning**
Deploy and serve your own fine-tuned models, including setup for training workflows and model versioning.

### üîÑ **Real-time Data Processing**
Stream processing pipelines that combine AI models with live data feeds for real-time insights and actions.

### üìä **Analytics and Monitoring**
Comprehensive monitoring setups for AI applications, including performance tracking, model drift detection, and usage analytics.

### üåê **Multi-modal Applications**
Applications that work with text, images, and other data types using Kamiwaza's flexible model serving capabilities.

### üîó **API Integration Patterns**
Common patterns for integrating Kamiwaza with existing systems, including webhooks, batch processing, and microservice architectures.
